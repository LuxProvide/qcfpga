# QCFPGA

* QCFPGA is a fork of the [QCGPU](https://github.com/libtangle/qcgpu), an open source, high performance & hardware accelerated, quantum computer simulator based on this [research paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.00988).
* Contrary to QCGPU, QCFPGA can be execute on Intel FPGA such as the Intel Stratix 10MX 16 GB FPGA (see https://docs.lxp.lu/system/overview/)
